### Solana Honeypot Pro

The Solana Honeypot Pro is a script designed to create a real honeypot token on SOL, offering native support for Raydium - most popular exchange in Solana. It is the ultimate program for making your own Solana honeypot token and extracting maximum possible revenue from your SOL memecoin. Solana Honeypot Pro by CryptoKoki offers easy and flexible settings that makes freezing holders fast, cheap and efficient. 

### 🚨 Key Features of Solana Honeypot Pro script

- 🍯 **Honeypot / Freezing**</br>
    
    Advanced honeypot system of Solana Honeypot Pro script automatically detects and freezes (i.e. block or blacklists) buyers of the token so they can’t either sell or transfer it. Once you’ve run honeypot script, every new buyer will be frozen immediately — nobody except you and whitelisted holders can sell. Everything happens completely automatically and requires no additional action from you: run it and your honeypot coin grow will be unstoppable 🚀
    
- 📄 **Whitelist Functionality**
    
    Whitelist feature of Solana honeypot script literally gives you fine-grained control over the token's liquidity and chart appearance: set privileged accounts of yours or your team, and they will be ignored by honeypot token, which means they can freely buy and sell token even though other buyers will be frozen as soon as they buy. It gives privileged wallets to influence the price chart and token liquidity by trading the token 
    
- 🏆 **Priority Fees for faster transactions**
  
  This feature establishes smooth and fast transactions for Solana honeypot. Priority fee is an extra gas fee that you are willing to pay for transaction. By adding more for priority status, your transaction will be more likely to be confirmed quickly by the network, which is crucial for any honeypot token on Solana.

- 🌡️ **Thawing or undo freezing**
  
  In case where there is an address that is supposed to be able to freely buy and sell tokens, wasn't added to the whitelist, and as result was frozen, Thaw feature will assist you to undo freeze operation, and give back to account ability to freely trade the token.
  
- 🛟 **Most user-friendly honeypot script and built-in Troubleshoot assistant**
  
  This feature will be your reliable assistant during the setup and launch of the honeypot script, especially if you are a beginner. When using a script for the first time, it's normal to make mistakes at settings, so we used wide user experience to process most common mistakes. If there’s an error, you will get a clear explanation of what caused the problems and steps to solve it right in the terminal. For errors that are out of script scope, we’ve prepared a Troubleshoot part in the PDF guide.

- 🚫 **Sale Threshold**

  Here you can specify a balance threshold below which holders will be ignored by the script and will not be frozen. If you decide to lower this value later, holders that were not frozen before will be reviewed to see if they meet the new threshold and respectively frozen.

- ⏰ **Automatic timeout for honeypot script**
  Set the time after which work of the script will be terminated automatically, if you don't want to do it manually. It's a little but really useful feature that will let you not care that honeypot script works too long without you watching.
